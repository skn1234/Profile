        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            <br><br>
            As a Bachelor of Technology graduate in Chemical Engineering, my foundational skills in the field were first honed at Government Polytechnic Pen, where I completed my diploma with a commendable 71%. <br> This early educational milestone built on my strong academic performance in secondary school, where I achieved an impressive 80.20%.
            <br><br>

            My technical proficiency is particularly strong in specialized software tools essential to modern chemical engineering. I have developed a varied skill set that includes expertise in Computational Fluid <br> Dynamics (CFD),which allows me to simulate fluid flow processes essential for optimizing industrial operations. Additionally, I am well-versed in Aspen HYSYS, a leading software for process simulation <br> in the chemical industry, whichenables me to design and analyze the performance of chemical plants effectively.
            <br><br>

            Moreover, my capabilities extend to MATLAB and Scilab, where I utilize these powerful platforms for numerical computation and algorithm development, facilitating data analysis and the solution of complex<br> mathematical problems related to chemical processes. This diverse software proficiency supports my ability to tackle a wide range of challenges in chemical engineering, from research and development to<br> process optimization and safety improvements.
            <br><br>

            My academic background and software skills equip me to contribute effectively to the field of chemical engineering, whether in academic research or in the practical, hands-on aspects of industry operations. <br>I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills in a dynamic professional environment to further my career and make meaningful contributions to the field.
